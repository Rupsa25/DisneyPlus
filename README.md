# DisneyPlus
This project involves the analysis of a Disney Plus dataset available on Kaggle. The initial steps include conducting exploratory **data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing**. To enhance data understanding, visualizations are created using the **Plotly** library. 

Subsequently, a **recommender system** is constructed. This system utilizes **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to generate feature vectors from movie descriptions. **K-Means clustering** is then applied to identify similar movies, enabling personalized recommendations.

To make the findings accessible, an application is developed using **Streamlit**. This application is deployed using the **Render** platform for public access.
